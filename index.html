          <p>
          Currently a senior in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, I am originally from a small town, West Grove, Pennsylvania (just west of Philadelphia). &nbsp; Being just short of the Delaware border, I attended high school at Salesianum School in Wilmington, DE. &nbsp; Engineering was not always such a sure path for me growing up. &nbsp; Throughout my life I have developed many interests that span a wide variety of subjects. &nbsp; At one point in my life I thought I would go into film production because I enjoyed creating small movies with my friends and later editing them with Adobe software. &nbsp; At another point I thought I would go into construction because I loved to build things (mostly treehouses and skateboard ramps).

                 Ultimately, I recognized a growing passion for developing with technology, particulary in the creative design process. &nbsp; Technology that tells a story, whether it be through a website, a mobile app, a responsive array of LED lights, or even a ride at a Disney park, is what interests me the most. &nbsp; Technology inspired by art is what I strive to conclusively work with the rest of my life.

             Throughout my life I have played multiple instruments (starting with the piano as most people do), however none have been as significant to me as the guitar. &nbsp; The guitar has always been an escape for me because it has a way of clearing my head from any worry or stress. &nbsp; Along with both acoustic and electric guitar I have learned to play bass guitar and

             I sing. &nbsp; I play a variety of genre's from acoustic/reggae to any form of rock. &nbsp; As a result I have been in a few bands and played some fun small gigs. &nbsp; Listed below is a few videos showing some of these performances.

             From about as far back as I can remember, I have been a Philadelphia Flyers fan. &nbsp; This lead to a long career of playing Ice Hockey for me that lasted until I started college. &nbsp; While I still remain a Flyers fan, I decided that I would not have the time to play at Virginia Tech in order to focus on school. &nbsp; I started lifting in high school but have since taken it more

              seriously without hockey to keep active. &nbsp; Lifting (or bodybuilding) is important to me because it involves setting goals and keeps me driven. &nbsp; That habit of pushing towards a goal carries over into how I handle other aspects of my life.
