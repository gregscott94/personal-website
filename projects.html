          <p>
          Currently a senior in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, I am originally from a small town, West Grove, Pennsylvania (just west of Philadelphia). &nbsp; Being just short of the Delaware border, I attended high school at Salesianum School in Wilmington, DE. &nbsp; Engineering was not always such a sure path for me growing up. &nbsp; Throughout my life I have developed many interests that span a wide variety of subjects. &nbsp; At one point in my life I thought I would go into film production because I enjoyed creating small movies with my friends and later editing them with Adobe software. &nbsp; At another point I thought I would go into construction because I loved to build things (mostly treehouses and skateboard ramps).

                <p id="jumbo-text">
                 Ultimately, I recognized a growing passion for developing with technology, particulary in the creative design process. &nbsp; Technology that tells a story, whether it be through a website, a mobile app, a responsive array of LED lights, or even a ride at a Disney park, is what interests me the most. &nbsp; Technology inspired by art is what I strive to conclusively work with the rest of my life.
